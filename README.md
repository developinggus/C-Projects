# C-Projects
Collection of projects from my CS211 course in Rutgers University 

//Descriptions of programs listed below : 

first.c
A program that will read an array from a file and print if the numbers in the file
are right truncatable primes.
A right truncatable prime is a prime number, where if you truncate any numbers from the right, the
resulting number is still prime. For example, 3797 is a truncatable prime number number because
3797, 379, 37, and 3 are all primes

second.c 
A linked list that maintains a list of integers in sorted order.
Thus, if the list contains 2, 5 and 8, then 1 will be inserted at the start of the list, 3 will be inserted
between 2 and 5 and 10 will be inserted at the end.

third.c
A hashtable that has the ability to insert,remove and search for items

fourth.c
Matrix multiplication. If it is possible to mulitiply two matrices, my program will return the result. 

fifth.c
This program checks whether are not a matrix square is "magic". A "magic" sqaure means the sum of each individual collumn, row, and diagonal, are equal. 

sixth.c
A simple piglatin converter!

ninth.c
A binary search tree that can input, searcg and delete!
